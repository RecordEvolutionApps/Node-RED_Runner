# Node-RED Runner
The Node-RED Runner is a version of the Node-RED app that is set up to execute a perviously given flow for development and test purposes.

## Usage Instructions

1. First you create a working flow with the regular [Node-RED App](https://studio.record-evolution.com/de/apps/Node-RED).
Note that your flow can also use UI widgets to display a live dashboard of your device/sensor metrics.

2. In the Node-RED App export the Flow unter MenÃ¼ -> Export and copy the flow to the clipboard.

3. Go to the Parameter settings of the Node-RED Runner app on your device and paste the flow into the Parameter field `Node-RED flow.json`. Save the parameters and restart the Node-RED Runner app.

If your flow contains a dashboard, then you can enable the Remote Access in the settings menu of the app. When you click on the app icon you then immediately see your dashboard

If you want to deploy your flow on a group of devices at the same time, you can also paste your flow into the parameter settings of the Node-RED Runner app installed on your device group.

# Creating Standalone Device Dashboards

The Node-RED Runner app is an easy way to test out your workflows on different devices, but to use your flow in a production environment we recommend you clone this app on GitHub and add your flow as a file into the app code repository. This way you gain full versioning support and improve usability for users since they don't have to configure anything to use the app.
